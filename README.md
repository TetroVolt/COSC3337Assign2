### The respective algorithms and their associated experiments were all 
each done by the respective people assigned to them.

data_prep.py is copied everywhere because of the assignment requirements to 
have separete folders when we originally had individual files in an src folder.

# Indivdual Contributions
### Raymond Sutrisno contributions
* data_prep.py - utility file for common functions
* RandomForest.py - file that actually runs the random forest tests
* Random Forest related experiments.

I also wrote the portion of the report about data set preparation,
the introduction, the analysis and conclusion, with the help of the others
team members in google docs for review and suggestions on wording and what to include. 

I wrote data_prep to standardized the output format to by the program and standardize procedures
