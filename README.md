# Contributions
### Raymond Sutrisno contributions
data_prep.py - utility file for common functions
RandomForest.py - file that actually runs the random forest tests

data_prep.py is copied everywhere because of the assignment requirements to 
have separete folders when we originally had individual files in an src folder.
I wrote data_prep to standardized the output format to by the program and standardize procedures
